I am an Economics and Management student [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), an intensive 16-week coding bootcamp focused on Ruby and Javascript, I look forward to joining a company where I can make a real difference as a junior developer besides my studies.


During my time at Makers Academy I learned how to think more like a programmer, write clean test-driven code, and pick up new languages and technologies. As such, I subscribe to Agile/XP values and would also look for opportunities to continue with TDD (test-driven development) and pair programming in any future role.
